Examples of analysis of on-farm experiments
====================================================

This repository was created to accompany the International Conference of Precision Agriculture (ICPA) satellite workshop 'On-Farm Experimentation and  Decision-Support Workshop' presentation by Dr Fiona H Evans, titled 'Data,  designs and analysis'. It includes a copy of the workshop presentation, as well as  data and an R markdown file describing detailing analyses of on-farm experiments.

I intend this to be a living repository and will be adding more to it as I learn more!
